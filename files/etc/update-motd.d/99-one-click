Welcome to DigitalOcean's 1-Click Statamic Droplet (forked from the Laravel Droplet).
To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
All ports are BLOCKED except 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

On the server:
  * The default web root is located at /var/www/statamic
  * Certbot is preinstalled. Run it to configure HTTPS. See
